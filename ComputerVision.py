# TensorFlow is an open-source software library
#   for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. 
# It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for 
#    machine learning applications such as neural networks. 
# It is used for both research and production at Google, 
#    often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.
# 
# Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. 
# It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, 
#    Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano. 
# Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, 
#    it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. 
# It was developed as part of the research effort of project 
#    ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System), 
#    and its primary author and maintainer is Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer.
#
# In 2017, Google's TensorFlow team decided to support Keras in TensorFlow's core library.
